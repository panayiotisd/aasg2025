    <h4>Workshop Introduction</h4>

    <p>
        This is the official website of the 6th International Workshop on Autonomous Agents for Social Good (AASG) 2025, in conjunction with the 24th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (<a target="_blank" href="https://aamas2025.org/">AAMAS 2025</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        This workshop focuses on the role of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (MAS) in social challenges, such as public health, sustainability, climate change and conservation, and human rights. The goal is to identify new MAS problems in societies, develop novel MAS solutions to resolve social challenges, and learn from the real-world deployment of MAS. 

         <!-- This workshop aims to provide a platform to exchange information, foster cooperation, and encourage the application of MAS to solve real-world social challenges by bridging the gap between researchers, NGOs, and society stakeholders. -->

        We are working on inviting NGOs (non-government organizations) from the USA and abroad to share their experiences and challenges. Engaging with practitioners and stakeholders is the best way to push research in social good forward. This workshop aims to provide an opportunity for MAS researchers to exchange ideas and promote collaboration with NGOs to tackle social challenges.

    <p>
        Social challenges of interest include, but are not limited to, public health, environmental sustainability and conservation, and human rights. Please see the <a href='call'>call for papers</a> for more details.
