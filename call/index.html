    <h4>Detailed Information</h4>
        <p>We solicit papers (work-in-progress, or published works with interesting novelty) in two categories:</p> 

        <p>1. <strong>Research papers</strong> describing novel contributions in resolving social challenges using multi-agent systems. Both work-in-progress and recently published work will be considered. Submissions describing recently published work should clearly indicate the earlier venue and provide a link to the published paper. Papers in this category should be at most <strong>8 pages</strong> (in AAMAS format), with any number of additional pages containing bibliographic references only.</p>  

        <p>2. <strong>Position papers</strong> describing open problems or neglected perspectives on the field, proposing ideas for bringing MAS methods into a new application area, or summarizing the focus areas of a group working on MAS for social good. Papers in this category should be at most <strong>4 pages</strong>, with any number of additional pages containing bibliographic references only.</p>  

        <p>The submitted papers will be assessed based on their novelty, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity of writing. <i>Collaboration with NGOs and society stakeholders that have first-hand knowledge of the topic will be especially appreciated.</i></p>

        <p>This workshop has no archival proceedings, and the accepted papers are allowed to be submitted to other conference venues. Accepted submissions will have the option of being posted online on the workshop website. For authors who do not wish their papers to be posted online, please inform the organizers. Accepted papers will be presented either as a research talk or a poster. We also welcome papers accepted at other venues to facilitate discussion. </p>  
    </p>


    <h4>Social Good Topics of Interest</h4>
    <p>
    We are interested in a broad range of research topics, both foundational and applied. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: </br>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> Public Health and Healthcare </li>
        <li> Environmental Sustainability and Environmental Crime </li>
        <li> Climate Change </li>
        <li> Conservation and Green Security </li>
        <li> Food Security </li>
        <li> Human Trafficking </li>
        <li> Human Rights </li>
        <li> Ethics, Fairness, and Discrimination </li>
        <li> Democracy and Civic Participation </li>
        <li> Fake News </li>
        <li> Security and Cybersecurity </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Scope</h4>
    <p>
    This workshop focuses on the role of multi-agent systems in social challenges and how MAS solutions can benefit societies. For example, what role can MAS play in tackling the challenges related to environmental sustainability? How can MAS techniques be used to determine public health policies? What actions can MAS research suggest to promote social justice? This workshop provides a platform to exchange information to bridge the gap between MAS researchers and practitioners who work on real-world challenges. We expect to invite speakers from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and practitioners to share their experiences in social challenges, followed by a panel discussion and poster session to exchange ideas. The goal is to understand the current state of research in MAS and the practice in social challenges, encouraging more collaboration between researchers and stakeholders of social challenges. The workshop will feature a combination of invited talks, panel discussions, research talks, and poster sessions. This workshop welcomes submissions spanning the full range of theoretical and applied works in MAS and social challenges.
    </p>

    <h4>Multi-agent Systems</h4>
    <p>
    This workshop welcomes any papers studying social challenges that involve MAS, including but not limited to: </br>	
    </p>
    <p>
    1. Identifying challenges within different domains in social good where multi-agent systems are involved, e.g., multi-agent interaction, communication, selfishness, challenges of collecting MAS data, and how to use MAS to resolve these issues.</br>
    2. Multi-agent system solutions for social challenges, including algorithmic game theory, mechanism design, optimization, machine learning, reinforcement learning, etc.</br>
    3. Real-world deployment of MAS solutions in various social good applications.</br>
